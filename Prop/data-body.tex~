\section*{Data Management Plan}

The data produced by this research effort will primarily involve 
test suites, sets of examples, programs synthesized, and
performance measurements for our algorithms.  We will also produce
software to implement our systems, notes, technical reports, research 
reports and presentations.  We have already set up a joint git repository
to hold and preserve all of this information.  We will make our software, data,
measuremens and reports open to other researchers and the public.
