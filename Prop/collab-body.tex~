\section{Collaboration Plan}
\label{sec:timeline}

The two PIs are uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed research.
Both PIs are experts in type systems and logic.  PI Zdancewic has been
developing a pure type-and-example-based system that will form the
initial kernel of the proposed work.  PI Walker brings experience in
data-driven synthesis from his past NSF-sponsored work on the PADS
project~\cite{fisher+:jacm,fisher+:popl06,mandelbaum+:pads-ml,fisher+:dirttoshovels,padsweb,daly+:pads-demo}.

% The PIs have worked together successfully in the past and the
% collaboration will get off to a quick start with PI Walker will be on
% sabbatical at Pi Zdancewic's institution (University of Pennsylvania)
% in the 2015-2016 academic year.

PIs Walker and Zdancewic already have weekly Skype video conference
calls to discuss
research on program synthesis.  These meetings will continue throughout
the duration of the grant.  In addition, PI Walker is planning to spend
a sabbatical at the University of Pennsylvania during the academic year
of 2015-2016.  We expect this concentrated time together will accelerate
the research productivity of the PIs and their students.  After this initial
year together, phone meetings will continue as will periodic in-person meetings.
(The University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University are only 1 hour away
by car or train.)  We have budgeted travel funds both for going to conferences
and to facilitate commutes back and forth between institutions when necessary.

\paragraph*{Software-development Infrastructure.}
The PIs' collaboration has already begun.  We have set up a joint git 
repository, which holds our code.  Git will store a main software
development branch and will allow us to generate experimental branches,
which may be later merged back in to the core.  Our git repository also
includes test suites, notes, technical reports, and documents relevant 
to the project (such as this proposal).

\paragraph*{Research Tasks and Timeline.}
Table~\ref{fig:timeline} summarizes the major pieces of the research
in terms of area.   The table lists the central research tasks and
provides expected start and finish times.
