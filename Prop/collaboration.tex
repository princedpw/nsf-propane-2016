Profs.\ Walker, Millstein, and Varghese have already been successfully collaborating with one another for the past few years in the areas of network programming and verification.  Walker and Millstein collaborated on the Propane network programming language; Walker and Varghese collaborated on the P4 language for packet processing; and Millstein and Varghese collaborated on the ERA tool for analyzing network configurations.  Through these existing collaborations, the team already has a well honed working relationship. 

A key strength of our proposal is the diversity of expertise among the PIs, ranging from programming languages to automated verification to network algorithmics.  As we have done for our prior and ongoing collaborations, we will continue to hold weekly team-wide videoconference meetings.  This mechanism allows everyone to stay abreast of the activities at both universities and enables all students to take advantage of the broad knowledge and perspectives represented across the team.  In this way, the PIs truly co-advise all graduate students, regardless of their location, which in our experience produces stronger, higher-impact research.  
We also have frequent email discussions between meetings.  Further, Millstein and Varghese have nearby offices and interact almost daily.

Due to our existing collaborations we already have a shared Github repository for code, data, and publications.  We will continue to use this repository to share and maintain our research artifacts.

A timeline of the proposed work is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline}.  Given the backgrounds and interests of the PIs, we envision a natural
split in the research work.  Walker and his students at Princeton will focus on developing novel language abstractions for expressive network policies, along with techniques for formally specifying and reasoning about such abstractions.  
Millstein, Varghese, and their students at UCLA will focus on developing algorithms for migrating low-level configurations to high-level policies as well as integrating such configurations correctly with high-level policies to support mixed operation. Finally, the entire team will collaborate to develop algorithms for synthesizing low-level network configurations that correctly and efficiently implement the high-level policies.
