\section*{Data Management Plan}

The data produced by this research effort will primarily involve test
suites, sets of examples, configuration files, configuration file
edits, programs synthesized, and performance measurements for our
algorithms.  We will also produce software to implement our systems,
notes, technical reports, research reports, teaching notes and
infrastructure, and presentations.  We have already set up a joint git
repository to hold and preserve all of this information.  We will make
our software, data, measurements and reports open to other researchers
and the public.  One exception may be configuration files we obtain
from University systems administrators.  These files may contain
information that could compromise the security of the configured
systems.
