We will make our code freely available to the research community, as we have done in the past.  The Data Management Plan states that we will maintain a project web page on Github that "will provide code, evaluation data, and meta-data."

While it is a potential concern that there could be too many roles to scalably handle, in our preliminary work to date we have seen that in practice even large networks have a relatively small number of roles, and further that nodes in the same role are intended to have similar policies.  These constraints are driven by the need for network engineers and operators to be able to more easily manage the network and understand its behavior.
